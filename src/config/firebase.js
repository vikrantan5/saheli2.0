/**
 * Firebase Configuration
 * 
 * SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
 * 1. Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com
 * 2. Select your project â†’ Project Settings
 * 3. Configure platform-specific files:
 * 
 * For Android:
 * - Download google-services.json
 * - Place in /app/android/app/google-services.json
 * 
 * For iOS:
 * - Download GoogleService-Info.plist
 * - Place in /app/ios/GoogleService-Info.plist
 * 
 * React Native Firebase automatically reads these config files.
 * No need to manually initialize here - it's done natively.
